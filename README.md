# FNF: Unity
A game, remade onto a different engine. For fun.

## Why
I was getting burnt out on a different project.

## Usage
Using this requires plenty of previous experience with Unity.
As it heavily uses the benefits of being on an engine like this.

Importing a song is easy.
The song importer tool is under the Tools tab.
Charting is done in FNF, as I am too lazy to make an editor.
Import the chart, add songs, and click import. It will show up and the songs folder in a specific format. Changing that format breaks that song, so don't go fucking with those basic files.
Each song has its own stage, known as Stage.unity.
These can be modified and should load correctly in game.
You can add your own scripts to each stage.
Designing a stage should also be much easier due to the WYSISWG editor Unity has.
